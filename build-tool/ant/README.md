### Ant on Windows
You need to manually install Ant on Windows, and you can follow its own [instruction](http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html).

To summarize the steps:
1. You need to have `java` installed and `JAVA_HOME` set on the `PATH` under `Environment Variables`
2. You need to download and unzip the compressed package containing `ant` from Ant's download page
3. You need to add the directory of the unzipped `ant` folder as `ANT_HOME` to the `PATH` under `Environment Variables`
