Chrome
======
[**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser) is a browser from Google, yet it is also a very useful web development tool, especially when it is installed with some extensions.

Once Chrome is installed, you can start installing extensions by navigating to `chrome://extensions/` on its address bar to enter the extension manager.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on `get more extensions` to reach the chrome web store page of extensions.

Alternatively, you can visit the [Chrome web store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) to get the extensions.
