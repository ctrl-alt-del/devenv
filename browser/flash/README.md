Flash

## Flash Issue on older PC
Newer Flash (version 11 and after) requires the `SSE2` feature, which was first introduced by Intel on its Pentium 4 CPUs.  However, AMD and other manufacturers include such feature only on their 64-bit CPUs.  Therefore, older computers with Pentium 3 or AMD 32-bit CPUs won't be able to get newer version of Flash to work.

The alternatives would be either using the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org), or installing Flash 10 plugins.

Using Flash 10 is not recommended because of the lack of security supports.
