Flash

## Flash Issue on older PC
Newer Flash (version 11 and after) requires SSE2 feature in the CPU, which Intel first introduced on its Pentium 4.  However, AMD and other manufacturers only include such feature on their 64-bit chips.  Therefore, older computers with Pentium 3 or AMD 32-bit chips won't be able to get newer version of Flash to work.

The alternatives would be either using the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org), or installing Flash 10 plugins.
