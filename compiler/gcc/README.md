### GCC on Windows
`gcc` is a tricky part for Windows users.  Often times, only the binaries are provided along with other projects, such as [Cygwin](http://sourceware.org/cygwin), [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) or [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org).

Since I want to use git-bash, I need to find the GCC compiler toolset, and I found [**TDM-GCC**](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net), which can fulfill my needs.
