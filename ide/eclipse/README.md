Eclipse
=======
[**Eclipse**](http://www.eclipse.org) is an integrated development environment (IDE).

Although Google recommends [Android Studio](#android-studio) for Android development, you can still use eclipse as your IDE if you prefer to.  I use one of its variant called [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr2) because it is relatively smaller than other variants.  You can to use its [standard package](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-44/lunar) or other variants as well.

* [**Ubuntu**](#eclipse-on-ubuntu)
* [**Fedora**](#eclipse-on-fedora)

### Eclipse on Mac
Visit the [Eclipse's download page](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads) and download the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** that fits your system (either 32 or 64 bit)

Once the file is downloaded, unzip it and drag the unzipped folder to application, then right click the eclipse icon inside the folder and click open.
