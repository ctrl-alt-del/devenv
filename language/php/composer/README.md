### Composer on Windows
The easiest way to install composer on windows in using the [installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe).

However, you can also install it manually on git bash following the same instruction as [Mac](composer-on-mac).

### Composer on Mac
```sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
move the `composer.phar` to somewhere in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/bin` so that it can be easily accessed.

You can trim off the `.phar` while you move it.
```sh
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer
```
