## Laravel on Windows


## Laravel on Mac
If you have installed `composer`, you can use it to install `laravel`
```sh
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

Once `laravel` is installed, you need to add the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` path to your `$PATH`.

Then you can create a new laravel project by doing:
```sh
laravel new <project_name> # <project_name> is a variable
```
