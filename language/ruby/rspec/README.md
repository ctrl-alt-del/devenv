RSpec
=====
[**RSpec**](http://rspec.info) is a Behavior Driven Development tool.  Rails is its prerequisite.

To verify Rails is installed in your machine, you can run:
```sh
rails -v # should show the version number
```

* [**Windows**](#rspec-on-ubuntu)

### RSpec on Windows
```sh
gem install rspec
```

Once installation is done, verify it by running:
```sh
which rspec
```
