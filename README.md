### About
I use both Mac and Windows regularly and sometimes Ubuntu as well.  Although I mostly use Mac as my coding machine, I am very interested in coding on my Windows machine as well.  After some researches as well as trials and errors, I am able to setup the dev environment on my Windows machine and I am pretty happy with it so far.  I think it may be a good idea to share the setup process with the community, and hopefully it can save other people some time :).

### Disclaimer
This document and bash scripts will be updated piece by piece and I will try my best to describe the process step by step.  Please feel free to let me know if you see anything confusing/unclear/wrong or you have any recommendations.  Thank you :).

## Configuration

### Configure Windows
It is a good idea to centralize all your packages in one folder.  Not only does it help to better organize your packages, having a dedicated folder for your packages also makes navigating with command line easier.  In this instruction for Windows, all packages will be put or installed under `~/Applications`, a.k.a `%USERPROFILE%\Applications`.  Please create the folder if it is not existed, and of course, feel free to name your own directory.

If you are familiar with Window's PowerShell, you can create the folder by opening PowerShell and run:
```sh
cd %USERPROFILE%
mkdir Applications
```
[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)


### Run as Administrator
For Windows's default command prompt or PowerShell, you will sometimes need the administrative permission to perform some tasks.  To run as administrator, right click on the `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` and select `Run as Administrator` option from the list.

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)


### Environment Variables
For Windows users, it is necessary to modified the Environment Variables (Env) so that some applications can be accessed through [terminal](#terminal).

Follow the steps to reach the interface of Env:
<br>
Right click `My Computer` -> click `Properties` -> click `Environment Variables`

Whenever a new application is installed and you want to access it through terminal, you can press `New` under the `System variables` section to add the application's path as an environment variable.

For `Variable name`, the convention is to use the upper case of the application's name and then concatenate it with `_HOME` (e.g. Python would be `PYTHON_HOME`).

For `Variable value`, just enter the full path of the application.

Once new Env is added, select `Path` row under the `User variables` section, and click the `Edit` button on below.  Go to the end of its `Variable value` and append the name of Env that you just created with a `;` as separator.  Click `OK` and you are done.

Alternatively, you can also use PowerShell script to add and update your Env.

To list all existing Env, open a PowerShell terminal and execute:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem Env:
```
Or you can just list the particular Env by executing: (replacing <variable_name> with the variable name)
```powershell
$Env:<variable_name>
```

## Wget
[**Wget**](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) is a free, open-source, command-line tool that downloads content from internet

* [**Mac**](#wget-on-mac)
* [**Ubuntu**](#wget-on-ubuntu)
* [**Fedora**](#wget-on-fedora)

### GCC Support
`gcc`, or [GNU Complier Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org) is a tricky part for Windows users.  Often times, only the binaries are provided along with other projects, such as [Cygwin](http://sourceware.org/cygwin), [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) or [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org).

Since I want to use git-bash, I need to find the GCC compiler toolset, and I found [**TDM-GCC**](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net), which can fulfill my needs.



### Git Theme
The theme of Git can be easily modified on the `/Git/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh` file.

One example theme would be:
```sh
PS1='\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:${PWD//[^[:ascii:]]/?}\007\]' # set window title
PS1="$PS1"'\[\033[1;32m\]'       # change to bold green
PS1="$PS1"'â†’ '                 # add an right arrow
PS1="$PS1"'\[\033[1;36m'       # change to bold cyan
PS1="$PS1"'\w'                 # current working directory
if test -z "$WINELOADERNOEXEC"
then
	GIT_EXEC_PATH="$(git --exec-path 2>/dev/null)"
	COMPLETION_PATH="${GIT_EXEC_PATH%/libexec/git-core}"
	COMPLETION_PATH="${COMPLETION_PATH%/lib/git-core}"
	COMPLETION_PATH="$COMPLETION_PATH/share/git/completion"
	if test -f "$COMPLETION_PATH/git-prompt.sh"
	then
		. "$COMPLETION_PATH/git-completion.bash"
		. "$COMPLETION_PATH/git-prompt.sh"
		PS1="$PS1"'\[\033[1;31m\]'  # change color to bold red
		PS1="$PS1"'`__git_ps1`'   # bash function

	fi
fi
PS1="$PS1"'\[\033[0m\]'        # change color
PS1="$PS1"' '                 # prompt: always space
```

The color is in ANSI 16-Colors code, and here is a short summary for the colors and styles:

##### Escape sequence:
There are two escape sequences: `\033[<code>m` or `\e[<code>m`

##### Text attributes
* `0` All attributes off
* `1` Bold on
* `4` Underscore
* `5` Blink on
* `7` Reverse video on
* `8` Concealed on

##### Foreground colors
* `30` Black
* `31` Red
* `32` Green
* `33` Yellow
* `34` Blue
* `35` Purple
* `36` Cyan
* `37` White

##### Background colors
* `40` Black
* `41` Red
* `42` Green
* `43` Yellow
* `44` Blue
* `45` Purple
* `46` Cyan
* `47` White

### Curl on Windows
Visit [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) to download the latest version of [`curl-[version].zip`](http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.43.0.zip).

Once it is downloaded, unzip it to `/c/usr/bin/curl`, or whatever directory your chose.

Run git bash as administrator, then create a symbolic link by running:
```sh
ln -s /c/usr/bin/curl/curl.exe /usr/bin/curl.exe
```
[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)


### Curl on Mac
Mac should have Curl by default.  You can verify your curl version by opening your terminal and running:

# General Setup

## Setup .bash_profile

* [**Automatic Way**](#automatic-way)
* [**Manual Way**](#manual-way)

You can configure your shell to have it memorize some convenient shortcuts.

If you are in Windows, you can open git bash as administrator by right click on the icon of git bash and select "Run as Administrator".

If you are in Mac or other Unix/Linux-base operating system, just open up your terminal.

### Automatic Way
Copy and paste the following codes to your terminal and hit enter/return to run them:
```sh
cd ~
\curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/master/util/setup_bash_profile.sh
chmod 755 setup_bash_profile.sh
./setup_bash_profile.sh
```
this should create a .bash_profile file if it is not existed and inject the shortcuts to the file.

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)


## Manual Way
If you prefer to create the .bash_profile file manually, you can do so by running:
`touch -pv ~/.bash_profile` on your terminal, if will create the file if it hasn't been created.  Afterwards, you can open it by running: `sudo vi ~/.bash_profile`and then add the scripts to it.  I use `vi` in this case, but you are free to use whatever editor you like, such as `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `subl`, `atom` and etc.

After the .bash_profile is created, restart the git bash to let the changes take effect.

## Flash Issue on older PC
Newer Flash (version 11 and after) requires SSE2 feature in the CPU, which Intel first introduced on its Pentium 4.  However, AMD and other manufacturers only include such feature on their 64-bit chips.  Therefore, older computers with Pentium 3 or AMD 32-bit chips won't be able to get newer version of Flash to work.

The alternatives would be either using the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org), or installing Flash 10 plugins.
