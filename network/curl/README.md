Curl
====
[**Curl**](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) is a tool to transfer data from or to a server.

Curl comes with Mac and some distros of Linux by default.  For Windows, it should comes with [Git](#git-on-windows).  In case Curl is not installed on your system, you can follow the instructions below to install it yourself.

* [**Windows**](#curl-on-windows)
* [**Mac**](#curl-on-mac)
* [**Ubuntu**](#curl-on-ubuntu)
* [**Fedora**](#curl-on-fedora)

### Curl on Windows
Visit [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) to download the latest version of [`curl-[version].zip`](http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.43.0.zip).

Once it is downloaded, unzip it to `/c/usr/bin/curl`, or whatever directory your chose.

Run git bash as administrator, then create a symbolic link by running:
```sh
ln -s /c/usr/bin/curl/curl.exe /usr/bin/curl.exe
```

### Curl on Mac
Mac should have Curl by default.  You can verify your curl version by opening your terminal and running:
```sh
curl --version
```

If curl does not come with your Mac somehow, you can follow the same instruction of [Windows](#curl-on-windows) to manually install it on your Mac.

Or you can install it through [Homebrew](#homebrew) by running:
```sh
brew install curl
```
