### Terminal on Windows
We are just going to use the Git Bash that comes with [Git](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/git#git-on-windows).

Alternatively, you can try [Cygwin](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/cygwin) or [Chocolatey](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/chocolatey).

### Terminal on Mac
You can either use the system default terminal, or you can also use [iTerm2](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/iterm2), which is an enhanced terminal for Mac.

For Ubuntu, Fedora, and all other Unix/Linux base operating system users, you can either use the system default terminal, or some other terminal applications, such as [Tilda](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/tilda) or [Guake](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/tree/master/terminal/guake).
