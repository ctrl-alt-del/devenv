### `yum` on Fedora
`yum` is the default package manager for Fedora.

In case that `yum` is not installed on your system, you can download the latest `yum` package from [here](http://yum.baseurl.org/download/3.4/yum-3.4.3.tar.gz) and install it manually.

Once the `.tar.gz` file is downloaded, unzip it.

Navigate into the unzipped folder and execute the configuration file, `./configure`

Afterwards, make the configuration, `make` and then install the make file, `make install`.

#### Additional Configuration
For RedHat and some other variant of Linux distros, you may need to perform additional configuration manually.

Please see details in [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Configuring_Yum_and_Yum_Repositories.html).
