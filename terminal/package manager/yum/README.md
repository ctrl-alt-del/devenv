### `yum` on Fedora
`yum` is the default package manager for Fedora.

In case that `yum` is not installed on your system, you can download the latest `yum` package from [here](http://yum.baseurl.org/download/3.4/yum-3.4.3.tar.gz) and install it manually.

Once the `.tar.gz` file is downloaded, unzip it.

Navigate into the unzipped folder and execute the configuration file, `./configure`

Afterwards, make the configuration, `make` and then install the make file, `make install`.
