# Setup `.bash_profile`

* [**Automatic Way**](#automatic-way)
* [**Manual Way**](#manual-way)

You can configure your shell to have it memorize some convenient shortcuts.

If you are in Windows, you can open git bash as administrator by right click on the icon of git bash and select "Run as Administrator".

If you are in Mac or other Unix/Linux-base operating system, just open up your terminal.

### Automatic Way
Copy and paste the following codes to your terminal and hit enter/return to run them:
```sh
cd ~
\curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv/master/util/setup_bash_profile.sh
chmod 755 setup_bash_profile.sh
./setup_bash_profile.sh
```
this should create a .bash_profile file if it is not existed and inject the shortcuts to the file.

### Manual Way
If you prefer to create the .bash_profile file manually, you can do so by running:
`touch -pv ~/.bash_profile` on your terminal, if will create the file if it hasn't been created.  Afterwards, you can open it by running: `sudo vi ~/.bash_profile`and then add the scripts to it.  I use `vi` in this case, but you are free to use whatever editor you like, such as `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `subl`, `atom` and etc.

After the .bash_profile is created, restart the git bash to let the changes take effect.

## Shortcut for external drive
If you setup you external drive with the same file structure as the internal drive, you can setup the shortcut to reach the `~` folder on the external drive as following:
```
alias sd='cd /Volumes/Data`printf ~`' # You can change 'sd' to anything else per your preference
```
