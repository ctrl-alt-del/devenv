alien
=====
`alien` is a tool for converting `.rpm` packages to `.deb` packages.  However, don't use it to convert and replace some important/system packages because those are usually set up, package and distribute differently.

This tool is mainly for Debian base system.

## `alien` on Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install alien
```
